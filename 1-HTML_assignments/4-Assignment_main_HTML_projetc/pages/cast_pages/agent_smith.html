          Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith
        </h3>
        <p>
          A sentient "Agent" program of the Matrix whose purpose is to destroy
          Zion and stop humans from getting out of the Matrix. Unlike other Agents,
          he has ambitions to free himself from his duties. Weaving stated that he
          found the character amusing and enjoyable to play. He developed a neutral
          accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to
          sound neither robotic nor human, and also said that the Wachowskis'
          voices had influenced his voice in the film. When filming began, Weaving
          mentioned that he was excited to be a part of something that would extend
          him. Jean Reno was offered the role, but declined, unwilling to move to
          Australia for the production.
