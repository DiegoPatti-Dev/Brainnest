          Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus </a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          A human freed from the Matrix and captain of the Nebuchadnezzar. Fishburne
          stated that once he read the script, he did not understand why other people
          found it confusing. However, he doubted if the movie would ever be made,
          because it was "so smart". The Wachowskis instructed Fishburne to base his
          performance on the character Morpheus in Neil Gaiman's Sandman comics.
          Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson and Val Kilmer were also considered for the part.
