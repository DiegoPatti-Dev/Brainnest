          Keanu Reeves as Thomas Anderson/Neo: A computer programmer, born Thomas A. Anderson,
          who secretly operates as a hacker named Neo. Reeves described his character as someone
          who felt that something was wrong, and was searching for Morpheus and the truth to break
          free. Will Smith turned down the role of Neo to make Wild Wild West, because of skepticism
          over the film's ambitious bullet time special effects.[17] He later stated he was "not
          mature enough as an actor" at that time,[17] and that if given the role, he "would have
          messed it up". Smith praised Reeves for his portrayal.[20] Nicolas Cage also turned down
          the part because of "family obligations".[21] Warner Bros. sought Brad Pitt or Val Kilmer
          for the role. When both declined, Leonardo DiCaprio initially accepted the role, but
          ultimately turned it down because he did not want to do a visual effects film directly
          after Titanic. The studio pushed for Reeves, who won the role over Johnny Depp, the
          Wachowskis' first choice.[22] Lorenzo di Bonaventura stated that the screenplay was
          also sent to Sandra Bullock, with the suggestion of rewriting Neo as a female.
