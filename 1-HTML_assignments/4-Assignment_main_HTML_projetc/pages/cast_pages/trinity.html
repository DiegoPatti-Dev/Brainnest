          Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity
        </h3>
        <p>
          A human freed by Morpheus, a crewmember of the Nebuchadnezzar, and
          later Neo's romantic interest. After reading the script, Moss stated
          that at first, she did not believe she had to do the extreme acrobatic
          actions as described in the script. She also doubted how the Wachowskis
          would get to direct a movie with a budget so large, but after spending
          an hour with them going through the storyboard, she understood why some
          people would trust them.[16] Moss mentioned that she underwent a three-hour
          physical test during casting, so she knew what to expect subsequently.The
          role made Moss, who later said, "I had no career before. None."Janet Jackson
          was initially approached for the role but scheduling conflicts prevented her
          from accepting it. In an interview, she stated that turning down the role
          was difficult for her, so she later referenced The Matrix in the 'Intro'
          and 'Outro' interludes on her tenth studio album Discipline. Sandra Bullock,
          who was previously approached for the role of Neo, was also offered the role
          of Trinity, but she turned it down. Salma Hayek and Jada Pinkett Smith (who
          would later play Niobe in the sequels) both auditioned for the role.
